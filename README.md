### ðŸ”´ You Have a (Milk) Drinking Problem.

Reaching for your 237th milk bottle of the day, you suddenly find yourself in a psychedelic time dimension where space is fragmented and reassembled through portals. The familiar laws of spatial connectivity crumble under your relentless quest for milk!

### ðŸ”´ Venture Through A Non-Euclidean Space to Escape!

Experience the mind-bending puzzles of ***HELP! I'm Trapped in the Psychedelic Time Dimension Again (Second Time This Week)***, a non-Euclidean puzzle game inspired by genre classics like *Antichamber* and *Manifold Garden*. Drawing from the essence of both titles, our game embraces the duality of portals. Sometimes, you must identify subtle spatial anomalies, while at other times, you're faced with obviously distorted spaces. Your challenge is to manipulate these portals to forge your path forward.
